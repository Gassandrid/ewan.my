## 6. Add a Yellow LED that is ON while the Red LED is OFF (alternating LEDs). **Take a picture** of Your Completed Circuit on the Breadboard, Connected to Your Pi.

## 7. What is the Current in Milliamps?

**Ohm's Law:**

   $$
   I = \frac{V_{supply} - V_{forward, red}}{R}
   Substituting the values:
   $$

**Red LED**:
   - $V_{supply} = 3.3V$
   - $V_{forward, red} = 2.0V$
   - $R = 220 ohms$

Plugging in values:

   $$
   I_{red} = \frac{3.3V - 2.0V}{220 \, \Omega} = \frac{1.3V}{220 \, \Omega} = 0.00591 \, \text{A} = 5.91 \, \text{mA}
   $$

**Yellow LED**:
   - $V_{supply} = 3.3V$
   - $V_{forward, yellow} = 2.1V$
   - $R = 220 ohms$

Plugging in values:

$$
   I_{yellow} = \frac{3.3V - 2.1V}{220 \, \Omega} = \frac{1.2V}{220 \, \Omega} = 0.00545 \, \text{A} = 5.45 \, \text{mA}
$$

**Results:**

$RED = 5.91 mA$

$YELLOW = 5.45 mA$

## 8. Use [https://www.lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com/) (free account with a .edu Email address), or [https://www.draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to Create a Circuit Diagram of Your Final Circuit (with both LEDs). **Take a screenshot** of Your Diagram.

You can't see it from the screenshot, but the glow follows your cursor as you hover over the card.

## Completed Code from Steps 5 and 6

Since I am on a Raspberry Pi 5 and not 4, the code had to be changed a bit during troubleshooting, so might be a bit unconventional.

**Step 5:**
