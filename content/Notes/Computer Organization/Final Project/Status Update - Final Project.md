## 3. Next Steps

Now that I have a general sense of how I want the model architecture to look like, I need to start designing a plan to train the model, not only to share the personality of TARS from interstellar, but to remain reliable at outputting formatted JSON for the function calling aspect. All of this, and to keep in mind the platform in which this model is going to be ran on, and how limited the available compute is.

I should also start looking into online GPU renting solutions, as training the model on my mac is not a viable option.

## 4. Challenges

The biggest issue by far is going to be optimization. LLM's require an enormous amount of computer, and even the smallest models on the market (8b parameters) won't run very fast on my Pi alone. For this reason, I will most likely need to purchase a TPU add-on, which adds another layer of complexity and debugging. 

If this doesn't work out, I always have the fallback of running the models through the cloud, and only interacting with them through API's.

If this doesn't work out, I always have the fallback of running the models through the cloud, and only interacting with them through API's. This isn't nearly as impressive as my main plan, but will mean the model will perform a lot better and be a lot more capable, however with some ethical barriers in place (I can't make the LLM have a sense of Humor!).
