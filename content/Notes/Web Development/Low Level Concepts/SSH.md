**SSH** is the primary method by which computers securely communicate over an insecure network. It is a protocol that provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using encryption.

How is this any different from HTTPS? HTTPS is a protocol that is used to secure communication between a web browser and a web server. It is built on top of HTTP and uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data being transmitted. SSH, on the other hand, is a protocol that is used to securely connect to a remote computer and execute commands on that computer. It is not built on top of any other protocol and does not use SSL/TLS.

Combining with [[Tailscale]] is probably the best way to use SSH securely from a distance.
