## Abstract

This video covers **Dynamical Systems Theory**, and how it can be used to model the behavior of systems in which time is a factor.

Looking at a Neuron, how can we apply this?

**Neurons are temporal computers**. Unlike the contrary, neurons don't only have "inputs" and "outputs" as factors, but also what that neuron was doing **1 millisecond ago, 1 second ago, or even minutes before**.

This is exactly what **Dynamical Systems Theory** is all about. This will cover differential equations, limit cycles, equilibrium points, and phase portraits.

We will learn the fundamentals in this note, and later apply it to **Neuronal Dynamics**

## State Variables

At its core, **Dynamical Systems Theory** is about studying things that change. This can be anything from a neuron firing, to a population of bacteria, or even a leaf floating in the water.

This is where **state** variables come into play. We use state variables to track the most important aspects of a phenomena. They will be **real numbers** used to **fully** describe the state of a system.

Let's take an example of a **ball in motion**

> [!Example]
> A ball is in motion within a 3d plane of existence. What are its **state variables**?

But this can range depending both on what you are examining, but **also** on what you ACTUALLY care about. Let's explain

The importance of this is that even though there might be other state variables that we can account for in our calculations, it is oftentimes unnecessary for what we are trying to find. And for extremely complex systems like neurons, it is vital to make sure we are only observing the state variables that matter to us. 

A neuroscientist observing the electrical properties of neurons might choose completely different state variables than, for example a biochemist would when observing the sugar content within, or the DNA being repaired.

We will talk about the **actual** state variables we use for neuroscience a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the formalism of the differential equations themselves.

Here's a sample of the equations to come:

$$
\begin{align}
C_{m} \frac{dV_{m}}{dt} &= \sum I_{ion} \\ \\
I_{K^+} &= g_{K} n^4 ( E_{K} - V_{m}) \\ \\
I_{Na^+} &= g_{Na} m^3 h (E_{Na} - V_{m}) \\ \\
I_{l} &= g_{l}(E_{l}-V_{m}) 
\end{align}
$$

## Differential Equations

This is a simple growth pattern, for which we can model like the following:

$$
N(t+1) = 2N(t)
$$

Where $N(t)$ is the number of bacteria at time $t$
