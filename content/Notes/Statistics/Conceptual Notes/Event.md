An **event** in statistics refers to a specific outcome or a set of outcomes from a random experiment or process. Events are the basic objects of study in probability theory, and they can range from simple occurrences, like rolling a specific number on a die, to more complex combinations of outcomes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Sample Space (S)**

   - The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. An event is a subset of the sample space.
   - Example: When flipping a coin, the sample space is \( S = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \} \).

### 2. **Simple Event**

   - A **simple event** (or elementary event) is an event that consists of exactly one outcome.
   - Example: Rolling a 3 on a six-sided die is a simple event: \( A = \{ 3 \} \).

### 3. **Compound Event**

   - A **compound event** involves two or more simple events. It is a subset of the sample space that includes multiple possible outcomes.
   - Example: Rolling an even number on a die is a compound event: \( B = \{ 2, 4, 6 \} \).

### 4. **Mutually Exclusive Events**

   - Two events are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if they cannot both occur at the same time. If \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive, then \( P(A \cap B) = 0 \).
   - Example: In a coin toss, the events "heads" and "tails" are mutually exclusive.

### 5. **Independent Events**

   - Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.
   - Example: Rolling a die and flipping a coin are independent events because the outcome of the die roll does not affect the outcome of the coin flip.

### 6. **Complement Of an Event**

   - The **complement** of an event \( A \), denoted \( A^c \), is the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are not in \( A \).
   - Example: If event \( A \) is rolling a 1 or 2 on a die, the complement \( A^c \) is rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6.

### 7. **Union Of Events**

   - The **union** of two events \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \cup B \), represents the event that either \( A \) or \( B \) or both occur.
   - Example: Rolling a 2 or an even number on a die is the union \( A \cup B = \{ 2, 4, 6 \} \).

### 8. **Intersection Of Events**

   - The **intersection** of two events \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \cap B \), represents the event that both \( A \) and \( B \) occur.
   - Example: If \( A \) is rolling an even number and \( B \) is rolling a number greater than 2, the intersection \( A \cap B = \{ 4, 6 \} \).

## Probability of an Event

The probability of an event \( A \), denoted \( P(A) \), is the measure of how likely the event is to occur. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, assuming each outcome is equally likely.

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in } A}{\text{Number of outcomes in } S}
$$

### Example:

For a six-sided die:

- The event \( A \) = rolling a 3: \( P(A) = \frac{1}{6} \).
- The event \( B \) = rolling an even number: \( P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

## Conclusion

Events are central to probability theory and statistics. Understanding how to define, combine, and calculate the probabilities of different types of events is essential for analyzing random experiments and making statistical inferences.
