## 1. Problem Definition
- **Identify the Task:** Determine whether the problem is classification, regression, clustering, or another type of problem.
  - Example: Is it a linear classification problem, or does it require more complex modeling?
- **Determine the Output:** Define what the model should predict (e.g., binary output, categorical labels, continuous values).

## 2. Data Collection & Preparation
- **Collect Data:** Gather the dataset(s) needed for the task.
- **Explore and Understand the Data:**
  - Visualize data distributions and relationships.
  - Identify missing values or outliers.
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
  - Remove or handle outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - **Normalization/Standardization:** Decide if data needs to be normalized or standardized based on the model type.
  - **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical data into numerical values using methods like one-hot encoding.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Create or select features that will improve model performance.

## 3. Splitting the Data
- **Train-Test Split:** Divide the data into training and testing sets (commonly 80/20 or 70/30 splits).
- **Validation Set:** Optionally, further split the training set into training and validation sets to fine-tune model parameters.

## 4. Model Selection
- **Choose a Model Type:**
  - **Linear Models:** For simple linear relationships.
  - **Deep Neural Networks (DNN):** For more complex tasks.
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** For image data.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** For sequential data.
- **Select Architecture:**
  - **Input Layer:** Match the number of neurons to the number of input features.
  - **Hidden Layers:** Determine the number of hidden layers and neurons in each based on problem complexity.
  - **Activation Functions:** Choose appropriate activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax).
  - **Output Layer:** Define based on the type of task (e.g., single neuron for binary classification, softmax for multi-class classification).

## 5. Model Compilation
- **Choose Loss Function:** Select an appropriate loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression).
- **Select
