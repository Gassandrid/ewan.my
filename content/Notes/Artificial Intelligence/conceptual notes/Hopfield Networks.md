# Hopfield Networks

## Overview
A Hopfield Network is a type of recurrent artificial neural network that serves as a content-addressable memory system with binary threshold nodes. It was introduced by John Hopfield in 1982 and is known for its ability to store and retrieve patterns, acting somewhat like an associative memory.

### Key Characteristics
- **Binary [Neurons](Neuron.md)**: Each neuron in a Hopfield Network has a binary state, typically represented as +1 or -1.
- **Symmetric Weights**: The connection weights between neurons are symmetric, meaning that the weight from neuron \(i\) to neuron \(j\) is the same as from \(j\) to \(i\).
- **No Self-Loops**: There are no self-connections in a Hopfield Network, so a neuron's state does not directly influence itself.

## Dynamics and Energy Function

### Energy Landscape
- The network's state is described by an energy function, similar to a Boltzmann Machine. The network evolves over time to minimize this energy, moving towards stable states, known as **attractors**.
- The energy function for a Hopfield Network is given by:  

  $$E = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} w_{ij} s_i s_j$$
  
  where $w_{ij}$ is the weight between neurons $i$ and $j$, and $s_i$ and $s_j$ are the states of the respective neurons.

### Stability and Convergence
- The network converges to a stable state (local minimum of the energy function) after a number of iterations. Once in a stable state, the network remains there, which corresponds to a stored memory.
- **Attractors**: The stable states or patterns that the network converges to are known as attractors. These attractors correspond to the memories or patterns stored in the network.

## Learning in Hopfield Networks

	### Hebbian Learning Rule
- The weights in a Hopfield Network are typically determined using Hebbian learning, which can be summarized as: "cells that fire together wire together."
- For a set of patterns $\{x^1, x^2, \dots, x^p\}$, the weight matrix $W$  is defined as:

$$
  w_{ij} = \sum_{\mu=1}^{p} x_i^\mu x_j^\mu
  $$
  
  where $x_i^\mu$ is the state of neuron $i$ in pattern $\mu$.

### Capacity and Limitations
- **Storage Capacity**: The maximum number of patterns that can be reliably stored in a Hopfield Network is approximately 0.15 times the number of neurons. Storing too many patterns leads to spurious attractors and errors.
- **Spurious States**: Unintended attractors that do not correspond to any of the stored patterns can occur, which can cause the network to converge to incorrect states.

## Applications and Significance

### Pattern Recognition
- Hopfield Networks are used in associative memory tasks, where the network can retrieve a stored pattern from a noisy or incomplete input. This makes them suitable for tasks like image reconstruction and error correction.

### Optimization Problems
- The network's ability to converge to a minimum energy state has been utilized in solving optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other combinatorial problems.

### Historical Importance
- The Hopfield Network was a significant step in the development of recurrent neural networks and laid the groundwork for more advanced models in artificial neural networks.
