title: Tech Stacks

I am no web developer, but when I am going to do web development, I would prefer to use one of the following to make my UI's work.

> [!Warning] Database Choice
> I will probably go with [Turso](https://turso.tech/) if I am doing some sqlite stuff, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for Document database stuff, and [Valkey(redis alternative)](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) for high speed in memory db, although this could change.

## Svelte Version

I am not the biggest fan of javascript frameworks, but this one is okay and I am happy to use if needed.

### Svelte + Axum

Similar to rust stack above, just that it uses svelte for the frontend.

### Maybe - Python With Flask

I don't use python in production like this, only as a testing/data science tool, but this might be usefull if I am doing something with machine learning or other, and want a simple frontend for a python app.

**It might also just be simpler to host a api with python as a backend and svelte at the front.**
